                    <h5 class="video-title">The Challenge</h5>
                    <p class="video-description">The Metaverse has skyrocketed in popularity, poised to become humanity's second world. It's not just an escape from reality; it's a canvas where people can fully express themselves and turn their wildest imaginations into tangible experiences within a vibrant community setting. We envision an ecosystem where individuals can harness the power of their second reality, empowered by blockchain technology to ensure transparency and trust. Our goal is to foster a space where creativity flourishes, enabling communities to craft their own digital goods and shape the Metaverse into a dynamic playground of endless possibilities.</p>

                    <h5 class="video-title">My Contributions</h5>
                    <p class="video-description">1. Designing the solution, combining all SHINTA VR products into a single platform</p>
                    <p class="video-description">2. Leading the blockchain development and syncing blockchain to the game by building our own infrastructure to sync Web3 and Web2 data.</p>
                    <p class="video-description">3. Project Management of this complex product</p>
                    <p class="video-description">4. CI/CD and development efficiency by automating tasks</p>
                    <h5 class="video-title">Results</h5>
                    <p class="video-description">COSMIZE has been perceived as a metaverse that is good-looking and above standard even by Japanese. They were impressed with our quality and bunch of features inside.</p>
                    <h5 class="video-title">Experiment: AI</h5>
                    <p class="video-description">In the evolving landscape of the metaverse, there is a need for intelligent conversational characters that can interact with users in a natural and engaging manner. Current chatbots and virtual assistants lack the depth and authenticity required to create immersive and meaningful interactions. Therefore, there is a demand for an AI-driven conversational character capable of understanding, responding, and adapting to user input in a dynamic metaverse environment.</p>
