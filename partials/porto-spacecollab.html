                    <p class="video-description">The global pandemic has restricted our ability to connect emotionally and share knowledge due to limitations on in-person gatherings. Additionally, training can be expensive as it requires resources for space, equipment, and other costs for both trainers and participants. Moreover, access to rooms, machines, and tools necessary for human development is often limited, further hindering opportunities for growth and learning.</p>
